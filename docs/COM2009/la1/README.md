## An Introduction to ROS

* [Week 1: ROS & Linux Basics](./week1)

    *In this first week you will learn the basics of ROS and become familiar with some key tools and principles of this framework, allowing you to program robots and work with ROS applications effectively.*

* [Week 2: Odometry & Basic Navigation](./week2)

    *In this session you'll learn how to control a ROS robot's velocity (and thus its position), how to interpret Odometry data and implement some open-loop control nodes.*

* [Week 3: Advanced Navigation & SLAM](./week3)

    *Implement odometry-based velocity control to make a robot follow a pre-defined motion path. Explore the LiDAR sensor, how the data form this device can be of huge benefit for robotics applications, and see this in practice by leveraging the autonomous navigation (and mapping) tools within ROS.*

* [Week 4: ROS Services](./week4)

    *Here, you'll learn how ROS Services can be used in combination with the standard publisher/subscriber principles that you already know about, to control a robot more effectively for certain operations.*

* [Week 5: ROS Actions](./week5)

    *Building on what you learnt about ROS Services last week, we'll now look at ROS Actions, which work similarly, but with key differences.*

* [Week 6: Cameras, Machine Vision & OpenCV](./week6)

    *Here we'll look at how to build ROS nodes that work with images from on-board camera, we'll look at techniques to detect features within these images that can then be used to inform robot decision-making.*
