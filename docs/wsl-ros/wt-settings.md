# Windows Terminal Settings {#wt-settings}

We use [the Windows Terminal](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/introducing-windows-terminal/) alongside WSL-ROS, to interact with our Ubuntu and ROS environment, and we've created a custom settings file to configure this appropriately. If you've used the Windows Terminal before on a University Machine, or if you have used the WSL-ROS environment previously and have modified the settings file that we have provided, then you'll be presented with the following prompt:

Enter `Y` to use the settings file that we have provided and overwrite whatever was there previously (recommended). Alternatively, enter `N` to preserve your own settings, but note that your experience will then differ to that presented throughout this Wiki, and some instructions may no longer work in the same way.
