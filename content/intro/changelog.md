|     2     |    2021-22    | Updated for a new release of the WSL-ROS Environment: now running Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic. All code templates now updated for Python 3, including nice things like [f-strings for all string formatting](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/). [Week 3 Exercise 4 (Autonomous Navigation)](Week-3#ex4) has been revised to use command-line calls to the `/move_base_simple` action server to make the robot move to navigation goals (rather than using the GUI tools in RViz), in the hope that this will make it easier to see how the same thing could be achieved programmatically instead. Removed an exercise in [Week 5](Week-5) to make it shorter (because it was a bit of a long one originally), but introduced [a couple of optional ones](Week-5#advanced) instead for those who wish to delve further. |
|     1     |    2020-21    | Initial release of the COM2009 practical ROS course and [the COM2009 Wiki](https://github.com/tom-howard/COM2009/wiki). Based on the brand new WSL-ROS environment (running Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS Melodic). |
